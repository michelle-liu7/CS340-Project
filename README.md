# CS340-Project
## Overview
An avid comic book collector acquires upwards of 200 books a year. Because their collection is constantly growing and changing, it is important to keep track of all their books in an efficient manner. With average prices ranging from $3.99-$4.99 per book, in just 5 years they will have invested around $4,000 in their collection. A database driven website will allow users to keep a record of all the comic books they own and how much money they have invested in their collection. Collectors will be able to easily add, remove, sort, and locate specific books they own, saving them potentially hours of work compared to sifting through each book by hand. This improves the quality of life of the collector and helps them better understand the contents, growth, and value of their comic book collection.
